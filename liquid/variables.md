## Fields

Fields contain the responses from the custom fields created on your
forms. They are accessed through either payment.fields or plan.fields.

When looping through fields, the actual variable name will be determined
by how you name the for loop in the template. In this example, the variable
will be called
`my_field`.

```
{% for my_field in payment.fields %}
  {{ my_field.title }}
{% endfor %}
```

- `field.title` - the title of the field
- `field.response` - the text response or the address on a single line

If the custom field type is an address, we will add an additional liquid field
called address with each of the parts of the address

- `field.address.line1`
- `field.address.line2`
- `field.address.city`
- `field.address.state`
- `field.address.postal_code`
- `field.address.county`
